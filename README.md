## Why I create this application

There is several reason why I created this application. I created this application to fulfill the qualification task for a volunteer position at Bersinar as a Front-End Developer. Joining the community as a volunteer and making contributions is also one of the things I want to achieve. Furthermore, this application also enhances my experience in the field of Front-End Development. As mentioned by Bersinar, this application can also add to my portfolio.
